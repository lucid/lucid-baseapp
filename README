This is a sample application that you can make a Lucid app from.

First, rename "AppName" and "AppName.js" to the sysname of your application. This must be unique to your application.

Next, replace all occurances of "AppName" with the sysname choosen above.

Lastly, change the name of your application in /nls/main.js.

You may add additional translations to the /nls/ folder. For example, if I wanted to make a spanish translation, I'd make a directory called 'es' and copy main.js (along with any additional files you have made) to that folder.

To make things easy to find, you should name your repository like so: lucid-app-AppName
This way it's easy to find.
