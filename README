About
=====
This is a sample application that you can make a Lucid app from. Simply fork this repository, and make your changes. Or, just download these files, and hack awaoy.

How To Customize
================
First, edit "meta.json", replacing each field with information regarding your application. See the developer documentation if you don't know how to do this.

Then, rename "AppName" and "AppName.js" to the sysname of your application. This must be unique to your application.

Next, replace all occurances of "AppName" with your app's sysname. The files you should look in are "AppName.js" and "AppName/_base.js".

Lastly, change the name of your application in /nls/main.js.

If you wish, you may replace 'icon.png' with a 16x16 icon for your application.

Adding More Translations
========================
You may add additional translations to the /nls/ folder. For example, if I wanted to make a spanish translation, I'd make a directory called 'es' and copy main.js (along with any additional files you have made) to that folder.

Repository Name
===============
To make things easy to find, you should name your repository like so: lucid-app-AppName
This way it's easy to find.
